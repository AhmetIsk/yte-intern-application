# yte-intern-application
This project is my final project when I was doing my internship at TUBITAK BILGEM YTE. 
During 5 weeks, I gained education about Spring, React.js, Java, SQL and Flutter and finally 
I coded a social event web application that people can enroll the listed events created by admin.
Admin creates, updates, deletes events and can also add participants like other people. Admin can 
also see the informations of users and events on a specific bar chart. 
Back End of project is coded with Java and Spring framework and Spring security, the data is stored
by using PostgreSQL and front end part is created with Javascript, React framework.
The application can be improved by creating mobile version with Flutter or React Native in the future.
